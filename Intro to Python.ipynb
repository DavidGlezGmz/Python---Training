However, the number of programmers using Python 3 at work has been on the rise in the last two or three years.  The Python Software Foundation has announced that in 2020, official support for Python 2 will stop.  Python 2 code will still work, but there will no longer be official security updates, or other forms of support.  It is my opinion that this will lead to a mass migration from Python 2 to Python 3 in professional development environments.\n","\n","So, if you're new to Python and wondering which version to learn, I'd recommend Python 3.
